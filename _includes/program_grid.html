                    <h3 class="text-left">Overview</h3>
                    <p class="text-left">Our program is designed to allow you to explore every aspect of web development, from database design to front-end coding and project management. To make this possible, we think it is important to keep you motivated by working on a real app that you have scoped yourself at the beginning of the course. Although you can expert to work on your main project during the whole length of the course, We divided the program in 9 main topics, which you can see and explore below.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-left">Schedule</h3>
